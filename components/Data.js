					    	'content': ["In the U.K we are known for our vast multi-cultural society; having more than two languages being spoken in a home for a number of families is now seen as the norm. The question Ipose today is whether a bilingual home, is an advantage or detrimental to the early development of a child?",
										"...Although I had my reservations about parents raising a child in a bilingual home, particularly children with speech delay. I also know from ﬁrst hand experience that it could be beneﬁcial for a child to understand their parent&#39;s native tongue. Having engaged in many debates on this matter, I held the view that a child hearing more than one language in the home, at such an early stage, could cause confusion or possibly a delay in speech. Moreover, diﬃculties differentiating between the two languages could also cause children to refrain from speaking altogether. After all, that is what some research indicted. Yet having conducted thorough research into this area, I can conclude that it is indeed a myth!!",
										"The question you may be asking yourself is, ‘Is this all relevant if my child has autism?’ The answer is ‘Yes’. A child with autism can be raised in a bilingual home in the same way as any other child would. Being bilingual does not have negative effects on a child with autism’s language development any more than a typical child.",
										"Some studies may indicate that it is not advisable for children with autism to learn another language. While others have proven that autistic children being bilingual have some cognitive beneﬁts. You are probably thinking how? Well.... Learning another language allows children to communicate with gestures and expressions to get what they are trying to say across and studies show that children with autism are less likely to do this but when they are bilingual they begin to communicate like this from a young age.",
										"Being bilingual, contrary to some people&#39;s beliefs, doesn&#39;t mean you need to be proﬁcient in each language, one language can be more prominent than the other. BUT with repetition of words and consistency in hearing these words, it will encourage knowledge and associations of language learning.",
										"... Worried about your child mixing up words, don&#39;t be! It is very common for children to mix up their words, exclude connectives and make grammatical errors. More words only make it worse!! If you think about it, adults who are bilingual engage in code mixing all the time, so really your child is just showing signs of perfecting their bilingualism. I thought I&#39;d share some tips with you if you would like to take the route of raising your child in a bilingual home. I mean, why not? What is really stopping you?",
										"Tips For A Bilingual Home",
										"Choose the dominant language - when working on initial ﬁrst words the dominant language should be encouraged. Consider choosing the dominant language based on your child&#39;s academic setting - It only makes sense that if your child is proﬁcient in a language, it should be reﬂected in their academic achievements, not to mention this will be the institution your child will spend countless hours of learning in!!",
										"Use simpliﬁed and concrete words in both languages - avoid idioms. During your ABA programmes, if your child gives a correct response in the language you didn&#39;t communicate it in, reinforce just as much if not more - remember it is still a correct response!!",
										"Be patient with your child, not all children grasp another language as easy as others. In addition observe your child&#39;s learning styles and modes of interaction. Make sure you adapt your teaching of the second language accordingly.",
										"In my opinion when choosing to bring your child up in a bilingual home it is a personal choice that should be agreed on by both parents. There are many factors to consider, but essentially it should be based on what&#39;s best for your child. You are the primary source of language for your child; they imitate, practice and engage in activities through interactions with you. Social interaction can be deﬁcit in some homes, so provide a natural and comfortable environment and if speaking your native tongue encourages social interaction and inclusion in the home, then go for it!!"

					    	'title': '10 BASIC PROGRAMME MUST HAVES',
					    	'content': ["Running an ABA programme can be very time-consuming and costly. There are a few valuable ‘must haves’, which can potentially affect the outcomes of your programme. An ABA programme should be credible, consistent and evidence based. Below I have recommended my programme essentials in no particular order, these basic items are affordable and very easy to implement.",

										"Tally counter/Clickers", 
										"This handheld tool allows you to count how many times a child communicates during a period of time. You can easily monitor the increase of verbal behaviour and draw comparisons, giving you the opportunity to explore alternative teaching methods if necessary. Not only is this counting device portable for data collection, but it can also be used on behaviour.",

										"Flashcards",
										"Whether they are bought or tailor made these cards are essential when running an ABA programme. Flashcards are excellent language builders and a simple way to teach. Irrespective of a child’s level of development, these cards can be used through each stage of development from basic to more advanced stages. Here are some examples of programmes that can be created using ﬂashcards:",
										" Matching",
										" Labelling",
										" Categorising",
										" Associations",
										" Adjectives",
										" Functions",
										" Features ",
										" Picture sequences",
										" Storytelling",
										"I would always opt for creating your own ﬂashcards as not all images bought in a pack may be suitable for teaching. Remember not only is creating your own cost effective in the long run, but your images can be made identical to items that the child uses on a day to day basis.",
										"Sometimes a child can encounter problems with their visual perception, such as picture discrimination. In such cases a plain background image (white preferably) can be used. Thus, items are clear and easy to identify without any distractions.",
										"Writing tools",
										"Writing is a motor skill. There are many physiological factors such as poor muscle tone that can affect how well a child can write. Teaching a child to write can be very diﬃcult to begin with. Don’t worry too much as there are tons of supportive writing materials to help a child write with ease.",
										"A child may ﬁnd holding a pencil diﬃcult to begin with ... If this the case creating fun activities using tongs, pegs or playing games that require the use of their ﬁngers and thumb to pick up items. This is an effective way to strengthen ﬁne motor skills.  Encourage pencil control and formation with drawing and tracing over basic shapes ... pencil grips to support holding.",
										"You may be wondering why I have included writing tools... Well handwriting support key skills in areas such as:",
										" Coordination",
										" Imagination",
										" Motor skills",
										" Visual attention ",
										" Reasoning ",
										"Writing is a functional skill, so it’s worth thinking about!!",

										"Stopwatch/Timer",
										"This is another simple hand held tool that can be useful when working on areas of attention. Alternatively, it can be used to support children to work more promptly.  For instance, you work with a child that ﬁnds it diﬃcult to sit at a table. First, you may require them to sit at the table with an enjoyable item for a very short period of time (20sec). You can then gradually increase the duration of each sitting once they have mastered the allocated time. Using a timer will help to accurately measure each trial more eﬃciently on timed tasks. Additional timing equipment can be used to support the concept of teaching time and task completion.",

										"VB tools/Assessment guides",
										"Assessments are crucial when monitoring the progress of development. Assessment tools should allow you to measure knowledge and performance over time. The VB-MAPP by Mark Sundberg is an excellent guide to begin with, but there a great deal of materials out there that can be used to measure speciﬁc areas of deﬁcit.",
										"ABA programmes are unique as they take on a holistic approach. Your ABA programme should incorporate a good mix of curriculum and life skills with clearly deﬁned goals and objectives. Make sure when choosing your assessment guides, it measures, the goal it is intended to measure and monitored eﬃciently. ",

										"Reinforcers",
										"This is the most essential of all, reinforcers are used for motivation and to strengthen behaviour. Reinforcement is likely to increase the chances of a desirable behaviour, to occur again. Your child’s preference to desired items can change very quickly, so make sure you keep a list of preferred items that you can refer to if necessary. Try to mix up the reinforcers and ensure that the most desirable items are given during more diﬃcult or spontaneous tasks.",
										"Reinforcers should be fun and given as frequently as necessary to motivate and strengthen behaviour. Ensure that the level of reinforcement given reﬂects the diﬃculty of the task. Once your child has mastered a generalised skill, 80% of the time, delayed reinforcers can be incorporated into the programme.",
										"Play activities ",
										"Play is a fantastic way to encourage language production … When working with children it’s important that they are able to play with a range of stimulating materials. You can teach many concepts through the use of play. Play materials can advance over time to become more age appropriate.  Several researchers have shown how signiﬁcant play can be to brain development. So not only should play be fun and perhaps structured depending on your goal. Make sure you take advantage of the social beneﬁts play can offer.",

										"ABC datasheets",
										"Applied behavioural Analysis is based on understanding behaviour through observation. The ABC datasheet is a simple form that can be ﬁlled indicating the antecedent (what happened before the behaviour occurred). Behaviour (what did the child do) and the consequence (what happened after?). ABC datasheets are the perfect application to use when looking at behaviour. By using this dataset you can assess behaviour, look at the function of behaviour, and then put forward strategies to address the behaviour.  This form also gives you the opportunity to look out for behavioural patterns. You may ﬁnd that a behaviour occurs regularly on an activity, with a person or even during a particular time of day.  Remember when we say behaviour we refer to actions in response to a situation antecedent).",

										"Stationary",
										"An ABA programme can be very expensive and making your own materials is not only cost effective, but can be a more beneﬁcial learning aid. You are able to create ﬂashcards or learning materials that are suitable to your child’s level. Materials can be made clearer and easier to read. Why not have your very own stationary table full of pens, paint pots and colourful paper etc. My must have stationary equipment to make materials for a programme are: Laminating sheets, a Laminating machine, Scissors and Velcro.  You will be amazed as to how much stimulating materials you can create and the ﬂexibility on adaptation. ",

										"Notebook ",
										"All too often we forget to look back on how hard our children work over the years. Sometimes we focus too much on the next target and forget how much progress they have made. We have a tradition… Remember the saying ‘It’s the little things that count’... We do just that!! We write down each milestone reached by our clients, no matter how big or small. ",

										"So this is your progress notebook... As time goes on, I would like you to note down anything the child did, that you didn’t see or realise they could do before and date it. Every so often you feel disheartened or need some encouragement, I would like you to open your notebook. When you look back you will be amazed at how much they have accomplished and how far they have come. I hope this helps in your progress to success!!"
