                </h2>
                <p class="">School of Academic and Behavioural Interventions (ABI), offers a consultancy and
                  management service to support parents and educational providers when working with
                  children on the autistic spectrum and related disorders.</p>
                <p class="">Autism is a lifelong diagnosis. Applied Behavioural Analysis (ABA) is one of many therapeutic
                  interventions used to support the learning, development of children with autism and related
                  conditions. After several observations and discussions held with school professionals it is
                  clear that educational providers are concerned about the progress of their pupils with
                  behavioural and educational diï¬ƒculties.</p>
                <p class="">The demand for ABA therapy is increasing throughout the UK and around the globe. The
                  recognition of evidence based practice and effectiveness is now welcomed by independent
                  schools and health professionals. We at School ABI believe that the earlier a child starts on a
                  tailored therapeutic programme, the better the outcomes will be.</p>
                <p class="">We understand that in many cases therapeutic interventions should not be limited to one
                  practice. We encourage working as a multidisciplinary team to gain different perspectives
                  on the complexity of the disorder and its characteristics. We recognise that collectively
                  working together we can produce lasting outcomes at each stage of development.</p>
                <p class="">Our aim is to support schools and home programmes in their journey towards inclusion and
                  building relationships with parents and teachers.
